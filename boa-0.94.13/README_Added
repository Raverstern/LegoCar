This is Boa, a high performance web server for Unix-alike computers,
covered by the Gnu General Public License.  This is version 0.94,
released January 2000.  It is well tested and appears to be of
at least "gamma" quality.

Boa was created in 1991 by Paul Phillips <paulp@go2net.com>.  It is now being
maintained and enhanced by Larry Doolittle <ldoolitt@boa.org>
and Jon Nelson <jnelson@boa.org>.

I've tried to cross compile the src files, but the executable file can't run on
the Zedboard. So I delivered the files onto the board and compiled them there, 
and it runned successfully.
