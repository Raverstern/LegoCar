Attention:
	In QuartusII, when you archive a project, there're two kinds of methods, which I don't really know the difference between them, called "Source Control" and "Service Request". Since I can't figure out what they are, I archived the project by these two methods respectively, and marked with a suffix of "_sc" the .qar file compressed by "Source Control" method.
